# Radar Simulation with Multiple Targets

This project simulates a radar system capable of detecting multiple targets at different distances. The transmitted signal, reflected signals, and noise are visualized for better understanding.

## Features
- Simulates multiple targets with varying distances.
- Adds noise to the received signal for realism.
- Calculates and prints the distances of all targets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
